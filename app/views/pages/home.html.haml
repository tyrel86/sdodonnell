	%p If you’re ready for an exciting read, then dive into <i>Deadly Memories</i>, S.D. O’Donnell’s debut psychological suspense novel. Turn off the phone and close door – you might not want to put the book down.
	%p Please spend a few minutes browsing these pages to learn more about me or read an except from the book. Check out News & Events to keep up with my work and to read news from the publishing industry.
	%p Add your name to my mailing list and I’ll let you know the latest as it’s available. That includes a notice on when the preview for my next book, <i>Deadly Bayou</i>, is ready.
	%p I’ll be posting a copy of the blues song referenced in the book: Last Day, by Delta Deon Slade. You can’t hear it anywhere but here and you’ll know right away when it’s up if you’re on my mailing list.
