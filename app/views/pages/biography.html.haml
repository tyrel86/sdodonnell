	%h1 Biography
	%p S.D. Oâ€™Donnell has a degree in Languages (German and English) and has worked as a free-lance author, a technical writer, a business consultant, and a multi-media producer. After many years in the business world, she decided to try her hand at her first love: writing fiction. The end result of that journey is the novel Deadly Memories.
	%p <b>S.D. O'Donnell's view on her writing style:</b> "I know I've done something unusual in writing from a male point of view but believe myself to be well-qualified to do so. My house is the gathering grounds for my former-Special Forces husband and his contingent of buddies (many of them former military, too). I give them food and drink, all the while observing what I consider my private research laboratory of male behavior."
